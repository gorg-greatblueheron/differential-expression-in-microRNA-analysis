Differential Expression of Circulating microRNAs in Sickle Cell Disease

Background: 
Sickle Cell disease (SCD) is an inheritable genetic disease disorder, with an elevated risk for chronic kidney disease, pulmonary embolisms, exertional rhabdomyolysis. 
The burden of the SCD affect 8 million people worldwide, especially non-Hispanic black or African American population.
Overview: 
This project analyzes circulating microRNA across three sickle cell disease (SCD) genotypes - HbAA(control), HbAS(carrier), and HbSS(diseased) - using high thoroughput sequencing data from the University Of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. 
The goal is to identify differentially expressed microRNA associated with genotype and to visualize patterns using volcano plots and heatmaps. 

Dataset
Source: UT Southwestern Medical Center
Samples: Plasma samples from self-identified black race human subjects with HbAS, HbSS, HbAA selected from the Mass General Brigham Biobank. HbAA were matched to HbAS(1:1) and HbSS(1:3) based on age, sex, and eGFR. The total sample size is 39.
